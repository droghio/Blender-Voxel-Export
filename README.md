Blender-Voxel-Export
====================

A blender voxelization and export addon. 
Will preserve hollow space inside of models, and other enclosed cavities.

Blender does not have built in voxelization export support, and while voxelization programs
exist many will not preserve data inside enclosed regions of the model.

When complete this script will add voxelization support to blender, and will include cavity data in the export.
